Pycraft is an OpenGL, open world, video game made entirely with Python. This project is a game to shed some light on OpenGL programming in Python as it is a seldom touched area of Python's vast amount of uses. Feel free to give this project a run, and message us if you have any feedback! <br />
Made with Python 3 64-bit and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

## Update Timeline
Pycraft will be continually updated for a long time yet. The next few releases, Pycraft v0.9.x will not feature as a (.exe) release but only as a code release. Pycraft will now updated gradually, not all in one go, however (.exe) releases will likely only occur at major releases like the upcoming Pycraft v0.10! The following plan was taken from my Medium article: How We are Making a Video Game in Python #2 (here: https://medium.com/@PycraftDev/how-we-are-making-a-video-game-in-python-2-547b504bbd67) <br />

At present this is the schedule for Pycraft updates: <br />

Major Version and Description | Minor Version and Description |
--- | --- |
**Pycraft v9** - This update aims to improve upon the design and functionality of the 2D engine for Pycraft in light of major changes to 3D engine. | **Pycraft v9.5** - This update aims to improve the design of the settings and benchmarking UI’s. We also are adding in a saves UI connecting the 2D and 3D engines together. We also aim to reprogram the settings menu, adding in an easier way to add extra settings in future as the 3D game engine continues to develop and expand. We also aim to reprogram the benchmarking process in line with the latest major changes to the 3D engine and to remove redundant features. Additionally, the benchmarking engine contains connections to other features that are no longer used and will be cleaned up considerably. We also want to bring more customizability to the benchmarking process and provide a more intuitive and helpful results screen. |
**Pycraft v10** - This update aims to make use of the additional functionality of the game engine by adding in lots of features and mechanics you would expect from any game. Nothing in this update is likely to be game engine specific (for example bosses, a storyline and special abilities). | **Pycraft v10.0** - This will be the big release of Pycraft and will mark the transition of development to focus on a new goal. Pycraft v10.1 - In this update we plan to add in the ability to properly save and safely exit the game, this functionality will link into the features we added in Pycraft v9.5. This functionality will be added to the inventory, however in a later update to Pycraft v10 that will change although the functionality will stay the same. **Pycraft v10.1** - In this update we plan to add in the ability to properly save and safely exit the game, this functionality will link into the features we added in Pycraft v9.5. This functionality will be added to the inventory, however in a later update to Pycraft v10 that will change although the functionality will stay the same. **Pycraft v10.2** - In this update we plan to add in the concept of water and oceans to the game engine (rivers and lakes will come later). This will include visual effects and relevant sound effects. **Pycraft v10.3** - In this update we will be adding in two ‘worlds’ which we will be using to test game mechanics, neither of which will be used in the final game. At this stage we want to add in collisions and also start work on improved movement and jump scaling for the game engine (the actual mechanics are already ok; we want to improve scale and speed). **Pycraft v10.4 *(this may end up swapping with Pycraft v10.1)*** - In this update we want to add in a HUD to Pycraft. **Pycraft v10.5** - In this update we want to start work on adding in structures to Pycraft, for example signs, fences, houses, farms. **Pycraft v10.6** - In this update, building off the earlier concept of structures we want to add in foliage, so trees, flowers and more to Pycraft. **Pycraft v10.7** - In this update we will be making significant changes to the Inventory and Map UIs. Both UIs will be combined together and will be assessed through tabs at the top of the screen. Both the unique key binds for the inventory and map will stay and will act as shortcuts to open this new UI to that area, we don’t plan to change that. This should make switching UIs easier. At this time both the Inventory and Map UIs will be redesigned with more functionality coming to both, however more game engine specific functions – like items will be added later in Pycraft v11. |
**Pycraft v11** - This update aims to extend the improvements to the game engine, however we are aiming here to add in game mechanics and features that will be more specific to Pycraft and its storyline, including starting work on the map for Pycraft, work on stage design and asset design for players, animals and other entities. | **Pycraft v11.0** - This will be the big release of Pycraft and will mark the transition of development to focus on a new goal. **Pycraft v11.1** - In this update we will start placing structures in their relevant locations on a flat grassy terrain. This we remove the initial two testing worlds. **Pycraft v11.2** - In this update we will start work on creating the map for Pycraft. This will be worked on in 1 km square chunks that we will work on and add gradually to Pycraft from this point (this will span many updates). **Pycraft v11.3** - In this update, regardless of how far through map design we are, we will be adding in locations to Pycraft (defined by regions in the ‘x’ and ‘z’ plane). This will then be displayed on the HUD and to game saves. Pycraft **v11.4-12** - In this update we will be focusing on each of the 9 dungeons for Pycraft (see next chapter). 8 of which will be testing the 8 skills to Pycraft (work in progress). This is a design and plan stage, not an implementation stage (That is the focus of Pycraft v12) |
**Pycraft v12** - This update aims to focus on larger projects in addition to rolling out the map for Pycraft. | **Pycraft v12.0** - This will be the big release of Pycraft and will mark the transition of development to focus on a new goal. **Pycraft v12.1** - In this update we will be adding in the starting ship for Pycraft’s storyline. **Pycraft v12.2** - In this update we will be adding in the harbour that you arrive into on your starter ship. **Pycraft v12.3** - In this update we will be adding in the castle (not grounds) including the areas of the castle that will be navigable to the end user. **Pycraft v13.4-12** - In this update we will be creating and adding in each of the dungeons for Pycraft. |
